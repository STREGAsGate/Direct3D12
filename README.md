# Direct3D12

Exposes Direct X 12's low level interface to Swift.

This package is under heavy development. Feedback is welcome.

The package is partitioned to mirror the orignal API locations and naming. 
This makes everything easier to locate based on the offical documentation.

Notes:
    - being written by hand, may contain typos or copy/paste errors
    - this package will not include the "DirectX 11 on DirectX 12" APIs
    - this package will skip the implimentation of offically deprecated API
