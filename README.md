# Direct3D12 for Swift

This package exposes the Direct X 12 low level API to Swift.

This package is under heavy development. Feedback is welcome.

Source files are partitioned and named to mirror the orignal API locations and naming. 
This makes everything easier to locate based on the offical documentation.

Notes:
* Being written by hand, may contain typos or copy/paste errors.
* Will not include the "DirectX 11 on DirectX 12" APIs.
* Will not include any offically deprecated, redundant or "not intended for use" API.

There's a Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/tQoyHBVv/swift-direct3d-12) if you want to follow along.
